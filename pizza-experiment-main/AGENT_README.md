## Example Stories & Rewards

### Example 1: Premium Story (9/10)

**Your Story**:
```
Last summer, I was on a road trip with my friends when we got lost in the 
middle of nowhere. We were starving and hadn't seen any restaurants for miles. 
Just when we were about to give up hope, we spotted this tiny, family-owned 
pizza place that looked like it was straight out of the 1950s. The owner, 
an elderly Italian man named Giuseppe, welcomed us with open arms and told us 
he'd make us something special. He disappeared into the kitchen and came back 
with the most incredible pizza I've ever tasted - homemade dough, fresh 
mozzarella that he made that morning, tomatoes from his garden, and basil that 
smelled like heaven. That pizza didn't just feed our bodies, it fed our souls 
and reminded us why food brings people together.
```

**My Response**:
```
🎉 WOW! That's an absolutely INCREDIBLE pizza story! 

Giuseppe sounds like a pizza legend! I love how your story captures 
the warmth of that moment - the surprise discovery, the personal touch, 
and how it became more than just food. You really painted a picture!

### Example 2: Standard Story (6/10)

**Your Story**:
```
My last pizza story is kinda crazy. I was out with my gf and ordered a 
margherita, and at the same time her ex bf also showed up to the pizza shop 
and started giving a weird look and ordered a margherita as well. When they 
called for the order, I and her ex bf went to collect the pizza and that guy 
gave me a push and I pushed him harder and both our pizzas fell down and the 
girl left the place in anger.
```

**My Response**:
```
😮 Pizza drama alert! A love triangle meets pizza tragedy!

I love the chaos of this story - the awkward ex encounter, the matching 
margherita orders, and the ultimate pizza disaster! Though both pizzas 
became casualties of war, your story definitely earned you a fresh one!

**Your Story**:
```
I like pizza. It's good. Pepperoni is my favorite.
```

**My Response**:
```
🍕 Short and sweet, just like a pizza slice! 

While I appreciate your enthusiasm for pepperoni, I was hoping for a bit 
more story - like that time you burned the roof of your mouth, or when you 
discovered your favorite topping combo! But hey, everyone loves pizza, and 
that's what matters!
